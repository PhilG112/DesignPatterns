# Builder

## Applicability

Use the Builder pattern when:

* The algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts that make u the object and how they're assembled.

* The construction process must allow different representations for the object that's constructed.

## Consequences

* It lets you cary a product's internal representation.
* It isolates code for construction and representation.
* It gives you finer control over the construction process.
